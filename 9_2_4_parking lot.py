Design a parking lot.

see CC150 OO Design for details.
1) n levels, each level has m rows of spots and each row has k spots.So each level has m x k spots.
2) The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars and buses
3) The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots
4) Each row, motorcycle spots id is in range [0,k/4)(0 is included, k/4 is not included), compact spots id is in range [k/4,k/4*3) and large spots id is in range [k/4*3,k).
5) A motorcycle can park in any spot
6) A car park in single compact spot or large spot
7) A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within same row. it can not park in small spots

Example
    level=1, num_rows=1, spots_per_row=11
    parkVehicle("Motorcycle_1") // return true
    parkVehicle("Car_1") // return true
    parkVehicle("Car_2") // return true
    parkVehicle("Car_3") // return true
    parkVehicle("Car_4") // return true
    parkVehicle("Car_5") // return true
    parkVehicle("Bus_1") // return false
    unParkVehicle("Car_5")
    parkVehicle("Bus_1") // return true
